# horizontalIonic2Tabs

This is an ionic2 project that uses divs, ul, li to create a horizontal tabs controller that can be used to control anything.

## This doesn't use the tabs component in ionic2 which gives great flexibility.

this depends on materialize css http://materializecss.com/tabs.html

## How to use:
npm install

then either ionic upload or serve as you like

Css can be changed under assets/css/...
